      <description>In the eyes of Arataki Itto, wielding a weapon on the battlefield is no different from a game of cards or beetle fighting with the neighborhood kids.

      <link>https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/18129</link>
      <description>Since childhood, Shenhe has lived in seclusion in the mountains, studying under an adeptus and practicing diligently day by day.

      <title>Character Demo - "Shenhe: Crane in the Wild" | Genshin Impact</title>
      <link>https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/18409</link>
      <description>Among the villagers who often traverse the mountains, there is a saying that goes like this:
When walking in the mountains, one must keep your eyes and ears wide open at all times to stay vigilant against evil spirits.
If you hear a mournful cry of cranes and feel a strong gust of wind wrapped in frost, it means that an exorcist or an adeptus is close by, slaying demons.
If that happens, take a detour and nothing should happen to you.</description>

      <description>In the eyes of Arataki Itto, wielding a weapon on the battlefield is no different from a game of cards or beetle fighting with the neighborhood kids.

      <title>Character Demo - "Shenhe: Crane in the Wild" | Genshin Impact</title>
      <link>https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/18409</link>
      <description>Among the villagers who often traverse the mountains, there is a saying that goes like this:
When walking in the mountains, one must keep your eyes and ears wide open at all times to stay vigilant against evil spirits.
If you hear a mournful cry of cranes and feel a strong gust of wind wrapped in frost, it means that an exorcist or an adeptus is close by, slaying demons.
If that happens, take a detour and nothing should happen to you.</description>
