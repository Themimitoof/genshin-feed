## Why Genshin feed born?

RSS servers and readers are superb tools to stay informed about the world and topics that interest you.
We all love Genshin Impact and want to stay informed about the news, upcoming events,
banners and upcoming releases without too much effort. That's why Genshin feed borns (until miHoYo
publish their own RSS/Atom feeds).

If you are an RSS/Atom addict and daily use a RSS Reader, you were probably frustrated to
see that miHoYo did not expose (yet) Atom/RSS feeds on their website. Some of you have probably tried
using online services that generate feeds by parsing websites but honestly, they are not reliable
solutions. Genshin feed is more reliable since it uses the same source that feeds the official
Genshin Impact website.

Genshin feed is the fruit of a very fast investigation and few hundred lines of code. It automatically
generates and update all feeds and this website every hour to make sure that you don't miss any news!
