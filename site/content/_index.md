# Welcome to Genshin Feed!

Hello and welcome to Genshin feed! You will find on this page all RSS and Atom feeds for
each langage and categories of the official news and announcements of Genshin Impact. All feeds are
automatically generated every hour and contain all news and announcements from the beginning of
Genshin Impact.

If you don't want to add all categories in your RSS reader/server, we also generate a feed that
combines all news and announcements from miHoYo!


## Why Genshin feed born?

RSS servers and readers are very good tools to stay informed about the world and the topics you
like. We all love Genshin Impact and want to stay informed about the news, upcoming events, banners
and upcoming releases.

If you are an RSS/Atom addict and daily use a RSS Reader, you were probably frustrated to
see that miHoYo did not expose Atom/RSS feeds on their website. Some of you have probably tried
using online services that generate feeds by parsing websites but honestly, it's not a reliable
solution. So, here came Genshin feed to serve you (until miHoYo publish their RSS/Atom feeds)!

After a very fast investigation and few hundred lines of code, an automated script born and retrieve
all news and announcements from the official Genshin Impact website, automatically and every hour.

If you are a developer or simply curious about how this project works, the project is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/themimitoof/genshin-feed) and published under the MIT license. This
means that you can reuse, adapt and contribute to the project!
