      <title>Character Demo - "Arataki Itto: Make Way for the One and Oni!" | Genshin Impact</title>
      <link>https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/17619</link>
      <description>The Vision, which was often carefully cleaned with flannel, had once been taken away from Arataki Itto.
But Itto has never been discouraged. On the contrary, after overcoming various hardships to regain his elemental power, his fighting spirit has burned even brighter.
Yes, that's right. I guess his mettle is exactly what makes him the boss of the Arataki Gang.</description>

      <title>Collected Miscellany - "Arataki Itto: Supreme Superstrength" | Genshin Impact</title>
      <link>https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/17730</link>
      <description>In the eyes of Arataki Itto, wielding a weapon on the battlefield is no different from a game of cards or beetle fighting with the neighborhood kids.
Both require a serious approach for the outcome to be determined righteously.
If you lose, you must quietly accept your loss, but if you win, you can reign supreme.</description>
